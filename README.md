# Intro-to-Github-demo
this is just a short intro to github for new users

when you use git, it allows you to store your code and commit it, so that you have banked copies of your code that you are logging.  
In git,you can also see public code repos for others, you can fork a git repo for your own use, contribute to it (if you're invited).
